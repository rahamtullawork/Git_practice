What is Java?
Java is a popular and powerful programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!
Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa


Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is mostly used for building desktop applications, web applications, Android apps, and enterprise systems.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java supports OOP concepts to create modular and reusable code.
Platform Independence: Java programs can run on any operating system with a JVM.
Robust and Secure: Java ensures reliability and security through strong memory management and exception handling.
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is known for being versatile and portable, designed to "Write Once, Run Anywhere," which allows developers to build applications that run on different operating systems and devices. Key uses include mobile apps, enterprise software, web applications, and big data processing.  
Key features and uses

    Versatile and portable:
    Java is used to build a wide range of software, from mobile and web applications to big data and cloud-based services. Its platform-independent nature means code can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

Object-oriented:
Java is based on an object-oriented programming model, which allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code. 
Automatic memory management:
Java includes an automatic garbage collector that manages memory, freeing developers from manual memory management and reducing the risk of memory leaks. 
Platform:
The Java platform includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which contains the JVM, core classes, and libraries needed to run Java applications. 
Cross-platform:
Java's ability to run on various platforms, including computers, smartphones, and other devices like IoT devices and smart TVs, makes it a strong choice for distributed environments. 
Multithreading and Concurrency: Java allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks for efficiency.
Rich API and Standard Libraries: Java provides extensive built-in libraries for various programming needs.
Frameworks for Enterprise and Web Development: Java supports frameworks that simplify enterprise and web application development.
Open-Source Libraries: Java has a wide range of libraries to extend functionality and speed up development.
Maintainability and Scalability: Java’s structured design allows easy maintenance and growth of applications.
Understanding the Hello World Program in Java
When we learn any programming language, the first step is writing a simple program to display "Hello World". 
So, here is a simple Java program that displays "Hello World" on the screen.
