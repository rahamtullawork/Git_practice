Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform, just like Google has its Google Cloud and Amazon has its Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Generally, it is a platform through which we can use Microsoft's resources. For example, to set up a huge server, we will require a huge investment, effort, physical space, and so on. In such situations, Microsoft Azure comes to our rescue. It will provide us with virtual machines, fast processing of data, analytical and monitoring tools, and so on, to make our work simpler. The pricing of Azure is also simpler and more cost-effective. Popularly termed as "Pay As You Go", which means how much you use, pay only for that.
